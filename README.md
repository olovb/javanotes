Java Notes
==========

Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. The project that later became Java was first initiated in 1991, and released to the public as Java 1.0 in 1995.

Some of the principles that guided the creation of the languange are:

- simple and familiar,
- robust and secure,
- architechture neutral and portable,
- high performance.

Java is compiled to __bytecode__ that is executed in a virtual machine, the JVM. 

The JVM together with the API comprises the __Java platform__.
